## Introduction

**mskilab-org/nf-casereports** is a bioinformatics pipeline from [`mskilab-org`](https://www.mskilab.org/) for running [`JaBbA`](https://github.com/mskilab-org/JaBbA/), our algorithm for MIP based joint inference of copy number and rearrangement state in cancer whole genome sequence data. This pipeline runs all the pre-requisite tools (among others) and generates the necessary inputs for running JaBbA and loading into [gOS](https://github.com/mskilab-org/gOS), our clinical front-end. It is designed to take paired tumor-normal samples or tumor-only samples as input.

## Workflow Summary:
1. Align to Reference Genome (currently supports `BWA-MEM`, `BWA-MEM2`, and GPU accelerated `fq2bam`).
2. Quality Control (using [`FastQC`](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/), [`Picard CollectWGSMetrics`](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360037269351-CollectWgsMetrics-Picard), [`Picard CollectMultipleMetrics`](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360037594031-CollectMultipleMetrics-Picard), and [`GATK4 EstimateLibraryComplexity`](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360037428891-EstimateLibraryComplexity-Picard))
4. Mark Duplicates (using [`GATK MarkDuplicates`](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360037052812-MarkDuplicates-Picard))
5. Base recalibration (using [`GATK BaseRecalibrator`](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360036898312-BaseRecalibrator))
6. Apply BQSR (using [`GATK ApplyBQSR`](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360037055712-ApplyBQSR))
7. Perform structural variant calling (using [`GRIDSS`](https://github.com/PapenfussLab/gridss))
8. Perform pileups (using [`AMBER`](https://github.com/hartwigmedical/hmftools/blob/master/amber/README.md))
9. Generate raw coverages and correct for GC & Mappability bias (using [`fragCounter`](https://github.com/mskilab-org/fragCounter))
10. Remove biological and technical noise from coverage data. (using [`Dryclean`](https://github.com/mskilab-org/dryclean))
11. Perform segmentation using tumor/normal ratios of corrected read counts, (using the `CBS` (circular binary segmentation) algorithm)
12. Purity & ploidy estimation (using [`PURPLE`](https://github.com/hartwigmedical/hmftools/blob/master/purple/README.md))
13. Junction copy number estimation and event calling (using [`JaBbA`](https://github.com/mskilab-org/JaBbA/)
14. Call SNVs and indels (using [`SAGE`](https://github.com/hartwigmedical/hmftools/blob/master/sage/README.md))

16. Assign mutational signatures (using [`SigProfiler`](https://github.com/AlexandrovLab/SigProfilerAssignment/))
17. Detect HRD (Homologous Recombination Deficiency) (using [`HRDetect`](https://github.com/Nik-Zainal-Group/signature.tools.lib))


## Usage

> **Note**
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how
> to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline)
> with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.

### Setting up the ***samplesheet.csv*** file for input:

You need to create a samplesheet with information regarding the samples you
want to run the pipeline on. You need to specify the path of your
**samplesheet** using the `--input` flag to specify the location. Make sure the
input `samplesheet.csv` file is a *comma-separated* file and contains the
headers discussed below. *It is highly recommended to provide the **absolute
path** for inputs inside the samplesheet rather than relative paths.*

For paired tumor-normal samples, use the same `patient` ID, but different
`sample` names. Indicate their respective tumor/normal `status`, where **1** in
the `status` field indicates a tumor sample, and **0** indicates a normal
sample. You may pass multiple `sample` IDs per patient, `nf-casereports` will
consider them as separate samples belonging to the same patient and output the
results accordingly.

Specify the desired output root directory using the `--outdir` flag.

The input samplesheet should look like this:

```csv
patient,sex,status,sample,lane,fastq_1,fastq_2
TCXX49,XX,0,TCXX49_N,lane_1,/path/to/fastq_1.fq.gz,/path/to/fastq_2.gz
```

Each row represents a pair of fastq files (paired end) for a single sample (in
this case a normal sample, status: 0).

After the input file is ready, you can run the pipeline using our `gOSh` CLI.

```bash
pip install bin/gosh # install gosh
gosh run pipeline
```

You can also run the pipeline directly using the following command:

```bash
nextflow run mskilab-org/nf-casereports \
   -profile <docker|singularity|institute> \
   --input samplesheet.csv \
   --outdir <OUTDIR> \
   --genome <GATK.GRCh37/GATK.GRCh38>
```
> **Warning:**
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow [`-params-file`](https://www.nextflow.io/blog/2020/cli-docs-release.html) option. Custom config files including those
> provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_;
> see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#custom-configuration-files).

#### JaBbA Pipeline

If you want to run only the JaBbA pipeline, you can use the following command:

```bash
gosh run pipeline --preset jabba
```

#### HR Deficiency (HRD) Pipeline

If you want to run only the HRD pipeline, you can use the following command:

```bash
gosh run pipeline --preset hrd
```


### Discussion of expected fields in input file and expected inputs for each `--step`

A typical sample sheet can populate with all or some of the column names as
shown below. The pipeline will use the information provided in the samplesheet
to parsimoniously run the steps of the pipeline to generate all remaining
outputs.

**N.B You do not need to supply all the columns in the table below. The table represents all the possible inputs that can be passed. If you are starting from BAMs just pass `bam` and `bai` columns. If you are starting from FASTQs, pass `fastq1` (and `fastq2` for paired reads). If you have already generated other outputs, you may pass them as well to prevent the pipeline from running tools for which you already have outputs.**

| Column Name         | Description                                                                                                                                  |

## Tumor-Only Samples

For tumor-only samples, simply add the flag `--tumor_only true` to the nextflow command. The pipeline will then run in tumor-only mode.

For more information regarding the pipeline usage and the inputs necesaary for each step, please follow the [Usage](docs//usage.md) documentation.

### Helpful Core Nextflow Commands:

#### `-resume`
If a process of the pipeline fails or is interrupted at some point, Nextflow can resume from that point without having to start over from the beginning. You must specify this in the `CLI` or on the `command-line` when restarting a pipeline. You can also supply a run name to resume a specific run using: `-resume` [run-name]. Use the `nextflow log` command to show previous run names.

#### `-profile`
Use this parameter for choosing a configuration profile. Profiles contain configuration presets for different computing environments.

Several generic profiles have been provided by default which instruct the pipeline to use software packaged using different methods. You can use this option to run the pipeline via containers (singularity/Docker) (**highly recommended**)

#### `-c`
You can mention custom configuration scripts to run the pipeline with using the `-c` flag and providing a path to the `.config` file. This is advised when you want to submit processes into an executor like `slurm` or `LSF`.

#### `-bg`
The Nextflow `-bg` flag launches the Nextflow pipeline as a background process. This allows you to detach or exit your terminal without interrupting the run. A log of the run will be saved inside a file upon completion. You can also use `screen` or `tmux` sessions to persist runs.

## Containers:
Every module in the pipeline has been containerized. Some modules are partially modified versions of [nf-core/modules](https://nf-co.re/modules), these modules use nf-core containers. Modules that use our lab packages and scripts were containerized into Docker images. These images can be found on our [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/repositories/mskilab).

> **Warning:**
> JaBbA depends on CPLEX MIP Optimizer to work. Because CPLEX is a proprietary software, it isn't included in the image and needs to be installed by the user.
> To add CPLEX:
>  1. Download CPLEX (Linux x86-64). (You may need to use the HTTP method.)
>  2. Pull image and run the container using:
> ```
> docker pull mskilab/jabba:0.0.1
> docker run -it --rm --platform linux/amd64 mskilab/jabba:0.0.1
> ```
>  3. Copy CPLEX binary into the container: docker cp /PATH/TO/DOWNLOADED_CPLEX.bin CONTAINER_ID:/opt/cplex_studio
>  4. Install CPLEX: /opt/cplex_studio/DOWNLOADED_CPLEX.bin (If you get a Permission denied error, run
>  chmod 777 /PATH/TO/DOWNLOADED_CPLEX.bin before copying it into the container.)
>  5. When prompted for an installation path, type /opt/cplex. This is what the CPLEX_DIR environmental variable is set to.
>  6. Save changes to a new image for future use:
>           Exit container (type exit or press Ctrl-D)
>           Run docker commit CONTAINER_ID NEW_IMAGE_ID


## Debugging any step/process:

To debug any step or process that failed, first check your current `execution_trace*.txt` file inside the `<outdir>/pipeline_info/` folder. There you'll find a `hash` number for that process. You can use that `hash` number to locate that process's working directory. This directory will contain multiple `.command.*` files that correspond to your run and contain valuable information that can help you debug your error. You can also run the `.command.sh` script to do a manual, isolated execution of the offending process for quick testing.
